# SCRUM Helper

**SCRUM Helper** is a Chrome extension designed to simplify writing scrums in Google Groups for FOSSASIA projects. By adding your GitHub username, date range, and other options, it automatically fetches your PRs, Issues, and reviewed PRs via the GitHub API and pre-fills the scrum. You can then edit the scrum to fit your needs.
