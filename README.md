# SCRUM Helper

**SCRUM Helper** is a Chrome extension designed to simplify writing scrums in Google Groups for FOSSASIA projects. By adding your GitHub username, date range, and other options, it automatically fetches your PRs, Issues, and reviewed PRs via the GitHub API and pre-fills the scrum. You can then edit the scrum to fit your needs.

## Using Scrum Helper with Your Own GitHub Organization

Scrum Helper is not limited to the [FOSSASIA](https://github.com/fossasia) organization. You can easily configure it to fetch and generate SCRUM reports for your own GitHub organization or repositories.

### Steps to Set It Up for Your Organization

1. **Install the Extension**

- Load it into your browser through [Chrome Extension Developer Mode](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/getstarted/).

2. **Update the Organization**

   - Currently, the extension uses `org:fossasia` to fetch GitHub issues and PRs.
   - To make it work with your GitHub organization:
     - Open `scrumHelper.js` (or wherever the GitHub API URLs are defined).
     - Replace:
       ```js
       +org:fossasia+
       ```
       with:
       ```js
       +org:your-org-name+
       ```
